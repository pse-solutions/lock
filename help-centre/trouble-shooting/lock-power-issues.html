    <h1>Lock power issues</h1>

    <h2>Lock does not power on after inserting or changing batteries</h2>

    <p>If you've changed the batteries on a dead lock, and the lock still does not turn on, follow these steps to troubleshoot:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Utilize a back-up power bank and plug it into the bottom of the outside of the lock.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the lock powers on, this will be an indicator that there is something wrong with the battery terminals on the back side of the lock</p>

    <ol start="2">
    <li>Replace the back side of the lock (battery side) with a spare back side of the lock</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once replaced, the lock will automatically reconnect to the TTLock platform.</p>

    <ol start="3">
    <li>If you do not have a spare lock on hand, follow these steps to adjust the positive battery terminals in the battery box</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Adjusting terminals is considered a temporary fix, and it is recommended to contact support@33lock.com for replacement parts.</p>
