<h1>Creating Keys</h1>

<p>Step 5 of the Getting Started Guide is to Create Keys. The TTLock platform supports various access methods.</p>

<h2>Passcodes (PIN Codes)</h2>
<p>Passcodes (aka PIN Codes) are a convenient and <strong>key-free way</strong> for different users to access a building. They are considered the <strong>most flexible credential</strong>, adapting well to any application, and <strong>do not require a medium</strong>, such as a card or device.</p>

<h3>Passcode Types</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Online codes</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes: Custom.</li>
            <li>Requires either a connection to a gateway or a direct Bluetooth connection to the lock.</li>
            <li>They can be added, modified, or deleted in <strong>real-time remotely</strong>, or directly at the lock.</li>
            <li>They can be <strong>customized to any 4 to 9 digit code</strong>.</li>
            <li>Custom codes allow you to choose whether they work permanently or set a specific start and end time (accurate to the hour).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Offline codes</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes: Timed, One-Time, Permanent, Recurring, Erase.</li>
            <li>These are generated algorithmically and <strong>don't require a Bluetooth connection to the lock or a network gateway to generate</strong>.</li>
            <li>They do require a Bluetooth connection to the lock to be modified or deleted.</li>
            <li>They <strong>must be used within 24 hours</strong> (except one-time, which is 6 hours) or they will be suspended.</li>
            <li>Offline codes are <strong>randomly generated</strong> and range from 6 to 9 digits in length.</li>
            <li>Types include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Timed: Set specific start and end times (accurate to the hour).</li>
                    <li>One-time: Valid for a single use only.</li>
                    <li>Permanent: Remains valid indefinitely until deleted.</li>
                    <li>Recurring: Choose a recurring cycle (daily, weekend, workday, specific day of the week) and set start/end times; only valid during the specified cycle.</li>
                    <li>Erase: Generate this code to remove all codes from a lock; all existing codes are permanently erased once entered.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps to generate passcodes in mobile app</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Select a lock from the main menu, then tap "Passcodes", then tap "Generate Passcode".</li>
    <li>Choose one of the Passcode types (Timed, Custom, etc.), and if applicable, specify the start and end times and assign a name, then tap "Generate".</li>
</ol>
<p>Once generated, the passcode can optionally be shared via email or SMS directly from the app using a pre-set template.</p>

<h3>Steps to generate passcode in web system</h3>
<ol>
    <li>From the main lock menu, click the number pad icon on the lock you want to generate a passcode for.</li>
    <li>Click the "+" button to select additional locks to add the passcode to, enter a "Name" and select one of the Passcode types. If applicable, specify the start and end times and assign a name, then click "OK".</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the passcode is generated, it can optionally be shared via email or SMS directly from the app using a pre-set template.</p>

<h2>Remote Unlock (WiFi Open)</h2>
<p>This feature allows users to <strong>unlock doors from any location, without needing to be near the lock</strong>. It requires the lock to be connected to a gateway. This function can be performed from anywhere, so it's a good idea to <strong>consider the security implications</strong> before proceeding. If you're using a third-party automation partner integrated with TTLock, remote unlock must be enabled.</p>

<h3>Steps to turn on remote unlock</h3>
<p>To enable remote unlock, it must be activated in the settings for each lock.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Determine if remote unlock is already on. If it is, you will see the words "Remote Unlock" in grey directly under the lock name, or you can see the blue network icon once a lock is selected.</li>
    <li>If remote unlock is not already turned on, select the lock that you want to enable remote unlock, then tap on "Settings".</li>
    <li>Tap on "Remote Unlock", then Tap the button to "Turn On".</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps to remotely unlock from app</h3>
<p>The lock must be connected to a gateway.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select a lock from the main menu, and confirm remote unlock is on.</li>
    <li>Tap on the small blue icon, then tap "Remote Unlock" when the confirmation prompt appears. The large blue lock icon is used for opening with eKeys and requires the user to be connected to the lock via Bluetooth.</li>
    <li>If remote unlock is successful, you will see a confirmation window.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps to remotely unlock from web system</h3>
<p>If Remote Unlock is already enabled for a lock, you will see a WiFi icon directly under the lock name.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the lock you want to remotely unlock.</li>
    <li>On the lock page, click on "Remote", then click on "Remote Unlock".</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cards (RFID Keys)</h2>
