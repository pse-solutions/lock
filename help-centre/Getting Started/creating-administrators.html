<h1>Creating Administrators or Transferring Ownership</h1>

<p>Step 4 of the Getting Started Guide is an optional step: Set Up Administrators or Transfer Ownership.</p>

<h2>Administrator Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When a new lock is added to an account, that account becomes the <strong>lock's administrator</strong>, having full control over lock settings and users.</li>
    <li><strong>Each lock has only one administrator</strong>.</li>
    <li>An administrator can <strong>transfer a lock's administrator status to another account</strong>. This can <strong>only be performed by the lock administrator</strong>. For example, an installer might transfer status to their client after installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transferring Locks</h2>
<p>Follow the steps for transferring locks.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a lock is transferred to another TTLock account, that account must have gateways added, or must be transferred gateways for the lock to be connected to the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to transfer a lock</h3>
<p>This can <strong>only be performed by the lock administrator</strong>.</p>
<ol>
    <li>From the main lock page, tap on the menu icon, and then tap "Settings".</li>
    <li>Tap "Transfer Lock(s)", select locks you want to transfer to another TTLock account and tap "Next".</li>
    <li><strong>Enter a valid phone number or email registered to a TTLock account</strong>, then click "Next". You will then be prompted to confirm the transfer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once transferred, you will no longer have access to the lock. To regain access, the new administrator must add you as an authorized administrator.</p>

<h2>Authorized Administrators</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The lock administrator can assign any other registered accounts <strong>Authorized Administrator status</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Each lock can have multiple authorized administrators</strong>.</li>
    <li>Authorized admin rights can be granted either temporarily or permanently.</li>
    <li>They can <strong>issue credentials like passcodes or eKeys</strong> to other users.</li>
    <li>They <strong>do not have the ability to add other authorized administrators</strong> to the lock. For example, a tenant can be granted authorized admin access to manage their own users while the building manager retains control.</li>
    <li>Permissions are displayed below each lock on the main menu. Locks labeled "Permanent/Admin" indicate that you are the administrator and can add authorized administrators.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to bulk add Authorized Administrators to a lock</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>TTLock Web Console only</strong> process and can <strong>only be performed by the lock administrator</strong>.</p>
<ol>
    <li>From the main lock page, click on the "eKey" icon for one of the locks you want to add an Authorized Administrator to.</li>
    <li>If you want to add this Authorized Administrator to other locks too, click on the "+" icon and select all the locks.</li>
    <li>Input the "Recipient Email", "Name", and select the "Type" of access. *The recipient email must already be registered with a TTLock account.</li>
    <li>Click the "<strong>Authorized Administrator</strong>" toggle, along with "Remote Unlock" if applicable.</li>
    <li>The recipient TTLock account will be notified, and will see all locks when logging into their account.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps to add an Authorized Administrator to a lock from the TTLock Mobile App</h3>
<p>This can <strong>only be performed by the lock administrator</strong>.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the lock from the main lock page then tap "Authorized Admin". If this icon is not present, you are not the administrator of the lock.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter a phone number or email that is already registered to a TTLock account</strong>, then tap "Send".</li>
</ol>
<p>Toggle "<strong>Manage their own users only</strong>" to prevent them from adding or deleting users other than those they have created. If toggled off, this user can delete users that others have created.</p>

<h2>Transferring Gateways</h2>
<p>You can also transfer gateways to another TTLock account. This can <strong>only be performed by the lock administrator</strong>.</p>
<h3>Steps to transfer a gateway</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Log into the app, tap on the menu icon, and then select "Settings".</li>
    <li>Select "Transfer Gateway".</li>
    <li>Select one or more gateways you want to transfer to another TTLock account, then tap "Next".</li>
    <li><strong>Enter a valid phone number or email registered to a TTLock account</strong>, then click "Next". You will then be prompted to confirm the transfer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once transferred, you will no longer have access to the gateway.</p>
