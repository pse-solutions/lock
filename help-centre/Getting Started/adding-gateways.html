<h1>Adding Gateways</h1>

<p>Step 3 of the Getting Started Guide is to Add Gateways. To manage locks remotely, they must be paired to a gateway.</p>

<h2>Important notes before adding gateways</h2>
  <h3>Network Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>G2 (WiFi) gateways require a network that supports a <strong>2.4GHz frequency</strong>.</li>
      <li>G3 (Cable) or G3P (PoE) gateways require configuring firewall settings to permit connection through <strong>port 2999</strong>.</li>
      <li>G4 (4G) gateways require obtaining a <strong>compatible SIM card and service provider</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Check Gateway Connection Strength</h3>
  <p>Tap “Nearby Locks” to bring up a list of locks that are currently connected to the gateway. From here you can do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>View the individual locks that are connected to the gateway</li>
  <li>View the connection strength between each lock and the gateway</li>
</ol>
<p>Each lock can be connected to multiple gateways. A lock that is showing a “Weak” connection to one gateway, may be showing a “Strong” connection to another.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This process is done using the <strong>TTLock iOS or Android App only</strong>.</li>
    <li>You <strong>must be next to the hardware with Bluetooth enabled</strong> on your mobile device.</li>
    <li>You need to <strong>confirm network requirements</strong> based on the gateway model.
        
    </li>
    <li>Ensure that <strong>each lock is within a 6m radius of a gateway</strong>. Gateways should generally be installed as close to locks as possible, with a <strong>recommended maximum range of 20-30 feet</strong>, but this could be impacted by obstructions. Additional TTLock gateways can always be added after installation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to add a gateway</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Log into the app and tap the Menu icon, select "Gateway", and then tap the "<strong>+</strong>" icon on the top right corner.</li>
    <img src="/assets/images/add-gateway-1.jpg" alt="TTLock App Add Gateway" style="height: 300px; width: auto;">
    <li>Tap on the <strong>correct gateway model</strong> (indicated on the label on the back).</li>
    <li>Physically <strong>connect the gateway to the power source</strong> (auxiliary or PoE).</li>
    <li>Once the gateway's LED is <strong>flashing red and blue</strong>, tap "Next". The gateway will time out if not connected within 60 seconds; to reset, unplug and plug it back in. It's best to add one gateway at a time.</li>

    <li>Tap the "<strong>+</strong>" symbol beside the gateway.</li>
    <li>For G2 WiFi gateways, you are required to <strong>select a WiFi network and enter the credentials</strong>. For G3 or G3P gateways, the device will automatically connect to the network. A flashing blue light means the gateway has connected to the network.</li>

    <li>Once the gateway is connected, it will automatically connect with nearby locks. You can check gateway to lock connection strengths by viewing "Nearby Locks" in the detailed view.</li>
</ol>
