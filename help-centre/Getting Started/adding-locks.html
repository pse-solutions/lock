<h1>Adding Locks</h1>

<p>Step 2 of the Getting Started Guide is to Add Locks. Before adding a lock, it is recommended to <strong>follow the installation materials to install the lock on the door</strong>. A lock <strong>must be added to an account before it can be used</strong>.</p>

<h2>Important points for adding locks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This process is done using the <strong>TTLock iOS or Android App only</strong>.</li>
    <li>You <strong>must be next to the hardware with Bluetooth enabled</strong> on your mobile device.</li>
    <li>You <strong>cannot add a lock that is already associated with another account</strong>. If the lock is associated with another account, you must either delete it from that account, transfer it from that account, or reset the lock.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to add a lock</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Tap the Menu icon on the main lock page, tap "<strong>+ Add Lock</strong>", and then tap "Door Lock".</li>
    <li><strong>Press any button on the lock keypad to activate pairing mode</strong>. You'll hear "Please add a Bluetooth administrator". Select the lock with the "+" icon from the list of nearby locks that appears. New locks will appear in blue; locks that have already been added to an account will appear in grey.</li>
    <li><strong>Assign a name to the lock</strong>. For certain lock types, you'll also need to specify the door's opening direction.</li>
</ol>
<p>After adding the lock, it's a best practice to **initialize lock settings for each lock**. This includes updating firmware, turning on remote unlock, and adjusting lock sound. These initial settings must be configured directly at each lock while you are next to the hardware with Bluetooth enabled.</p>
