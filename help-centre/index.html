    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How far should I install my TTLock gateways from my 33 Locks?</h3>
    <p>Gateways should generally be installed as close to locks as possible. The recommended maximum range of a gateway is 20-30 feet, but could be impacted by obstructions between the gateway and lock.</p>
    <p>Additional TTLock gateways can always be added after installation.</p>

    <h3>What happens to my 33 Locks during an internet outage?</h3>
    <p>Your 33 Locks will continue to operate with all previously installed credentials (PINs, cards, etc.). Already installed credentials will become active and deactivate according to their defined schedule.</p>
    <p>New credentials cannot be added or deleted remotely during the outage and must be added directly at the lock, or generated offline.</p>

    <h3>What happens to my 33 Locks if a gateway loses internet connectivity or power?</h3>
    <p>TTLock gateways create a many-to-many (M2M) mesh network, which means if any one gateway loses power or connectivity, your 33 Lock will attempt to connect to the next closest gateway.</p>

    <h3>How often do I need to update firmware on my locks?</h3>
    <p>Firmware updates are infrequent, and can occur approximately 2 times a year. While 33 Lock encourages all users to update firmware when available, updates are most often optional, and may not be required to install immediately. See Lock Firmware Instructions here.</p>

    <h3>What to do if my 33 Lock dies suddenly?</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Plug a power bank into the bottom of the lock to attempt to provide power.
        <ol>
        <li>If this works, it's likely that the batteries are dead. Replace asap.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the lock still doesn't power up, use a metal key to access the unit.</li>
    <li>Remove the battery cover and inspect the battery terminals for corrosion or other obvious damage.</li>
    <li>If the terminals look okay, replace them with brand new batteries to see if this resolves the issue.</li>
    <li>If the lock still doesn't power up, remove the lock from the door and inspect the cable connecting the front and back of the lock.
        <ol>
        <li>Confirm that the two ends are securely connected.</li>
        <li>Confirm there is no damage to the cable.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If there are no signs of connection issues or damage, replace the lock with one from your attic stock.
        <ol>
        <li>It's okay to keep the mortise chassis in the door and just replace the front and back.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Add the new lock on to the TTLock app.
        <ol>
        <li>If using an access automation partner, contact them asap to onboard the new lock.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Contact your installer and support@33lock.com to create a warranty claim.</li>
    </ol>
