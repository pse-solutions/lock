<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Passcodes</strong> (aka PIN Codes) are a convenient and key-free way for different users to access a building. Often considered the most flexible credential, adapting well to any application. PIN codes do not require a medium, such as a card or device.</p>

<h2>Passcode Types</h2>

<h3>1. Online codes</h3>

<p>Includes: <strong>Custom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires either a connection to a gateway or a direct Bluetooth connection to the lock.</li>
<li>They can be added, modified, or deleted in real-time remotely, or directly at the lock.</li>
<li>They can be customized to any 4 to 9 digit code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Custom</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose whether this code should work permanently or set a specific start and end time</li>
<li>Set specific start and end times (accurate to the hour)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Offline codes</h3>

<p>Includes: <strong>Timed, One-Time, Permanent, Recurring, Erase</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are generated algorithmically and don't require a Bluetooth connection to the lock or a network gateway.</li>
<li>Although they can be generated without a connection, they do require a Bluetooth connection to the lock to be modified or deleted.</li>
<li>They must be used within 24 hours (except for one-time codes, which must be used within 6 hours) or they will be suspended for security reasons.</li>
<li>Offline codes are randomly generated and range from 6 to 9 digits in length.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Timed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set specific start and end times (accurate to the hour)</li>
</ul>

<h4>One-time</h4>
<ul>
<li>The code is valid for a single use only and becomes inactive afterwards</li>
</ul>

<h4>Permanent</h4>
<ul>
<li>The code remains valid and can be used indefinitely until it's deleted</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recurring</h4>
<ul>
<li>Choose a recurring cycle for the code: daily, weekend, workday, or a specific day of the week</li>
<li>Set specific start and end times (accurate to the hour)</li>
<li>The code is only valid during the specified cycle</li>
</ul>

<h4>Erase</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generate this code to remove all codes from a lock</li>
<li>Once entered into the lock, all existing codes will be permanently erased</li>
</ul>
