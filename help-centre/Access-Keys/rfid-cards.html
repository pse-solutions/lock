<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Cards</strong> (aka RFID keys) are a more traditional type of access method, with the majority of properties already leveraging this technology.</p>

<h2>Adding cards</h2>

<h3>1. Add a card using a lock</h3>

<p>Must be next to the hardware with Bluetooth enabled on your mobile device</p>

<p>TTLock iOS or Android App only</p>

<p>Any lock can be used to add a card into the system. Once the card is added, it can then be assigned to other locks using the TTLock Web Application.</p>

<ol>
<li>From the home screen, select a lock</li>
<li>Tap "Cards"</li>
<li>Choose if you want the card to be "Permanent", "Timed", or "Recurring"
    <ol>
    <li>If "Timed" or "Recurring", set the validity period</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Assign a name and tap next</li>
<li>The lock will ask you to present the card</li>
<li>Present the card against the front of the lock</li>
</ol>

<p>If at this point you want to program this card onto other locks too, follow these steps:</p>

<li>Click "Issue Card"</li>
<li>Click "Sync Card" and the card you added to the lock will appear in the list</li>
<li>Click "Issue" next to the card you want to program and then choose the locks that you want that card to be programmed to and click "OK"</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Add a card using a card reader</h3>

<p>Lock must be connected to a gateway</p>

<p>The card encoder must be plugged into a laptop or desktop computer, and the user must be logged into the TTLock Web Console.</p>
