<h1>Administrators</h1>

<h2>Admin Roles & Permissions</h2>


<h3>Administrator Overview</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When a new lock is added to an account, that account becomes the <strong>lock's administrator</strong>, having full control over lock settings and users.</li>
    <li><strong>Each lock has only one administrator</strong>.</li>
    <li>An administrator can <strong>transfer a lock's administrator status to another account</strong>. This can <strong>only be performed by the lock administrator</strong>. For example, an installer might transfer status to their client after installation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authorized Administrators</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The lock administrator can assign any other registered accounts <strong>Authorized Administrator status</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Each lock can have multiple authorized administrators</strong>.</li>
    <li>Authorized admin rights can be granted either temporarily or permanently.</li>
    <li>They can <strong>issue credentials like passcodes or eKeys</strong> to other users.</li>
    <li>They <strong>do not have the ability to add other authorized administrators</strong> to the lock. For example, a tenant can be granted authorized admin access to manage their own users while the building manager retains control.</li>
    <li>Permissions are displayed below each lock on the main menu. Locks labeled "Permanent/Admin" indicate that you are the administrator and can add authorized administrators.</li>
