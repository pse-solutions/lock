<h1>Creating Keys</h1>

<p>The TTLock platform supports various access methods:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="#passcodes">Passcodes (PIN Codes)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#remote-unlock">Remote Unlock (WiFi Open)</a></li>
    <li><a href="#cards">Cards (RFID Keys)</a></li>

</ol>

<h2 id="passcodes">Passcodes (PIN Codes)</h2>
<p>Passcodes (aka PIN Codes) are a convenient and <strong>key-free way</strong> for different users to access a building. They are considered the <strong>most flexible credential</strong>, adapting well to any application, and <strong>do not require a medium</strong>, such as a card or device.</p>

<h3>Passcode Types</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Online codes:</strong>
        <p>Online codes require either a connection to a gateway or a direct Bluetooth connection to the lock.</p>
        <p>They can be added, modified, or deleted in <strong>real-time remotely</strong>, or directly at the lock.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Offline codes</strong>
        <p>Offline codes are generated algorithmically and do not require a Bluetooth connection to the lock or a network gateway.</p>
        <p>Although they can be generated without a connection, they do require a Bluetooth connection to the lock to be modified or deleted.</p>
        <p>They must be used within 24 hours (except for one-time codes, which must be used within 6 hours) or they will be suspended for security reasons.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remote-unlock">Remote Unlock (WiFi Open)</h2>
<p>This feature allows users to <strong>unlock doors from any location, without needing to be near the lock</strong>.</p>

<p>It requires the lock to be connected to a gateway. This function can be performed from anywhere, so it's a good idea to <strong>consider the security implications</strong> before proceeding.</p>   

<p>If you're using a third-party automation partner integrated with TTLock, remote unlock must be enabled.</p>

<h3>Steps to remotely unlock from app</h3>


<h2 id="cards">Cards (RFID Keys)</h2>
<p>Cards (aka RFID keys) are a more traditional type of access method, with the majority of properties already leveraging this technology.</p>

<p>Cards can be added into the system using a lock or by using a card reader.</p>

<p>Any lock can be used to add a card into the system. Once the card is added, it can then be assigned to other locks using the TTLock Web Application.</p>

<h2 id="ekeys">eKeys (Digital Keys)</h2>
<p>eKeys are digital keys. Types of eKeys include: Timed, One-Time, Permanent, or Recurring.</p>

<p>eKeys can be sent to users via email or SMS, and they can be used with the TTLock app on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Once users are granted access to an eKey, they will be prompted to create a TTLock account and access the key from their mobile devices.</p>

<h3>eKey Types</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bluetooth eKeys:</strong> use BLE technology which requires users to be in close proximity to the lock they want to open.</li>
    <li><strong>Remote Unlock eKeys:</strong> allow users to open door locks from their mobile device using the internet. With Remote Unlock eKeys, users can open the doors from anywhere, so long as their mobile device has internet connectivity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fingerprints">Fingerprints</h2>
<p>Fingerprint access allows for quick and secure entry without the need for physical keys or cards.</p>

<p>Fingerprint access can be granted to staff or long-term residents and must be programmed at each individual lock.</p>
