<h1>Administrators</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When a new lock is added to an account, that account becomes the lock's administrator, with full control over lock settings and users. Each lock has only one administrator. An administrator can transfer a lock's administrator status to another account.</p>

<p>For example, an installer might add locks to their account and transfer status to their client after installation.</p>

<h2>Authorized Administrators</h2>

<p>The lock administrator can assign any other accounts authorized administrator status. Each lock can have multiple authorized administrators.</p>

<p>Authorized admin rights can be granted either temporarily or permanently. They can issue credentials like passcodes or eKeys to other users, but do not have the ability to add other authorized admins to the lock.</p>

<p>For example, a tenant can be granted authorized admin access to their own lock, allowing them to manage their own users while the building manager retains control and ownership of the lock.</p>
