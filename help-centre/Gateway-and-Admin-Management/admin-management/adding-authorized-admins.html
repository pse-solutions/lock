<h1>Adding Authorized Administrators (bulk and single)</h1>

<p>Authorized Administrators can be added to locks by the lock administrator. This can be done either in <strong>bulk, via the TTLock Web Console</strong> or <strong>individually, via the TTLock Mobile App.</strong></p>

<p>Authorized Administrators can manage their own users, but cannot add or delete other Authorized Administrators.</p>

<h2>Steps to Bulk Add Authorized Administrators to a Lock (TTLock Web Console only)</h2>

<p>Can only be performed by the lock administrator</p>
