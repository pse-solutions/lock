    <h1>View Gateway ↔ Lock Connection Strength (Mobile App)</h1>

    <h2>1. Navigate to “Nearby Locks”</h2>
    <p>
      From the Gateway Detailed View, tap the <strong>Nearby Locks</strong> button to display all locks currently within the gateway’s radio range.
    </p>
    <!-- [IMAGE HERE] -->

    <h2>2. Interpreting Connection Strength Indicators</h2>
    <p>A list of locks appears, each with a signal‐strength indicator:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strong:</strong> Optimal signal strength (ideally positioned).</li>
      <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Sufficient but may occasionally drop (consider relocating).</li>
      <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Unreliable connection (move lock or gateway closer).</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- [IMAGE HERE] -->

    <h2>3. Multiple Gateway Connections</h2>
    <p>
      Each lock can be paired with more than one gateway. If a lock shows a “Weak” connection here, check its signal on other gateways (stronger links
      may exist). Always choose the gateway showing a “Strong” connection for mission-critical doors.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Improving a Weak Connection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relocate the lock or gateway to minimize obstacles (e.g., metal doors, thick walls).</li>
      <li>Consider adding a Wi-Fi repeater or another gateway to create mesh coverage.</li>
      <li>Ensure the gateway`s firmware is up to date (check “Update Firmware” in the Detailed View).</li>
    </ul>
