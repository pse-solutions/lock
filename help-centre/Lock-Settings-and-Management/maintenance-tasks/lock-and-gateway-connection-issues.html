    <h1>Initial Lock and Gateway Connection Issues</h1>

    <h2>Newly onboard lock does not connect to a gateway</h2>

    <p>Please note, when adding a new lock or gateway to the TTLock application, it may take up to 3-5 minutes for the pairing to take place. Pairing will occur automatically, and does not require you to have the pairing screen open to complete.</p>

    <p>If you've onboarded a lock onto the TTLock platform and it does not connect to a previously onboarded gateway, follow these steps to troubleshoot:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Ensure you have added the gateways to the TTLock application</li>
    <li>If you previously added the gateways, log into the TTLock platform and follow the steps here to check if your gateways are online</li>
    <li>If gateways in proximity of the lock are showing online, allow for 3-5 minutes for the onboarded lock to pair with the gateway.</li>
    </ol>
