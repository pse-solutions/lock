<h1>Backup Power</h1>

<p>The TTLock platform will notify you when the battery life of your lock is 20% or less. It is recommended that you change your lock's batteries when you receive this notification.</p>

<p>All 33 Locks come enabled with an auxiliary power port, located on the outer side of the lock at the bottom of the lock body.</p>

<h2>Steps to use backup power</h2>

<ol>
<li>Ensure your power bank is charged</li>
<li>Plug the USB cable into your power bank</li>
<li>Plug the USB-C side of the cable into your lock and the lock should turn on</li>
<li>Enter any valid credential, open the door and replace the batteries</li>
</ol>

<p>If the lock does not turn on after following the steps above, a physical key override can be used to open the lock.</p>
