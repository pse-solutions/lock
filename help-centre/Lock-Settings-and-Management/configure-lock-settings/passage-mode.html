<h1>Passage Mode</h1>

<p>Passage mode allows you to set schedules for specific locks to remain unlocked. When in unlocked state, lock users do not have to input any credentials to enter the room.</p>

<p>Use cases for passage mode include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping doors unlocked in specific common areas (pool access, etc.)</li>
<li>Keeping doors unlocked for staff, contractors, or maintenance personnel who may need access to rooms or areas throughout the day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to enable passage mode</h2>

<ol>
<li>Select the lock you want to view the unlock status, then tap "Settings"</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Tap the blue "+" button, and select the days and the timeframe for which you want the lock to remain open.</li>
</ol>

<p>*If you do not input a schedule, the lock will remain open until the passage mode is toggled off.</p>

<p>*With the free version of TTLock, users can only add one schedule per lock.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>The final step to enable passage mode on a lock is to present any valid credential to the lock during the specified schedule. The lock will notify you that it's in passage mode.</li>
</ol>
