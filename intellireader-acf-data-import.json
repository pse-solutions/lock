For example, one reader could control both a vehicle gate and a pedestrian gate, or both the exterior door and an interior door of an airlock/mantrap configuration. For more complex multi-door scenarios, multiple readers can be networked together and managed from the same interface.</p>"

                        "question": "What happens during a power outage?",
                        "answer": "<p>IntelliReader requires constant power to operate, but your access system's fail state depends on the type of locks used. Magnetic locks (fail-safe) will unlock during power loss, while electric strikes (fail-secure) will remain locked. For critical applications, we recommend connecting to a battery backup or UPS to maintain operation during power outages. The reader itself has a memory backup that retains all access credentials and settings regardless of power status.</p>"

                        "question": "Is IntelliReader suitable for outdoor installation?",
                        "answer": "<p>Yes, IntelliReader has an IP66 rating which means it's dust-tight and protected against powerful water jets. It's suitable for installation in covered outdoor locations or areas exposed to weather. For extreme environments or direct exposure to heavy rain and snow, we recommend installing under an overhang or using our optional weather shield accessory to extend service life.</p>"

                        "answer": "<p>IntelliReader is compatible with 13.56 MHz MIFARE format cards and fobs (including Classic, Ultralight, and DESFire). If you're currently using this format, your credentials will likely work. The reader is not compatible with 125 kHz proximity formats (like HID ProxCard or EM4100). We offer a credential migration service to help properties transition from older systems, including options to support dual-format credentials during the transition period.</p>"

The system can automatically assign and revoke credentials based on reservations, check-ins/check-outs, and other PMS events.</p>"
