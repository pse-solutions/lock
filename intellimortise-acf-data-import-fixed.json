                        "answer": "<p>IntelliMortise combines commercial-grade durability with user-friendly smart access features. Its key differentiators include the 20-minute fire rating, weather resistance (IP55), and flexibility to choose between touchscreen and push-button interfaces. The mortise design provides superior security compared to cylindrical locks, and our offline operation capability ensures functionality even during network outages.</p>"

                        "question": "How long do the batteries last?",
                        "answer": "<p>The 4 AAA batteries typically last 12-15 months with normal use (approximately 10-20 entries per day). Battery life will vary based on usage frequency, connectivity settings, and environmental factors. The lock provides low battery warnings through the app and on the lock itself when levels reach approximately 20%, giving you ample time to replace them.</p>"

                        "answer": "<p>IntelliMortise includes multiple backup options: 1) A USB-C emergency power port on the bottom of the exterior escutcheon, 2) A mechanical key override hidden behind the logo plate, and 3) Non-volatile memory that retains all programming even when power is completely lost. Once power is restored, all your settings and access credentials remain intact without reprogramming.</p>"

We have direct integrations with platforms like Cloudbeds, Mews, and other popular systems. For specialized PMS integrations, our technical team can provide guidance on API usage or suggest middleware solutions to connect your systems.</p>"

The 304 stainless steel components resist corrosion in most environments. For coastal environments with extreme salt exposure, we recommend the PVD coating option for extended durability.</p>"
