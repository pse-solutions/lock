                        "question": "Can IntelliLever replace any lever handle?",
                        "answer": "<p>IntelliLever is designed to replace most standard lever handles and doorknobs on interior doors with a thickness of 35-65mm (1⅜\" - 2½\") and standard backsets of 60-70mm (2⅜\" - 2¾\"). It is not suitable for mortise locks or deadbolts. If you are unsure about compatibility, our team can help assess your specific door setup before you purchase.</p>"

                        "question": "How long do the batteries last?",
                        "answer": "<p>The 4 AA batteries typically last 10-12 months with normal use (approximately 10-15 entries per day). Battery life may vary based on usage frequency, connectivity settings, and environmental factors. The lock provides low battery warnings through the app and on the lock itself when levels reach approximately 20%, giving you ample time to replace them.</p>"

                        "question": "What happens if the batteries die?",
                        "answer": "<p>IntelliLever includes multiple backup options: 1) An emergency micro-USB port for temporary power, 2) A mechanical key override, and 3) Non-volatile memory that retains all programming even when power is completely lost. Once power is restored, all your settings and access credentials remain intact without reprogramming.</p>"

                        "answer": "<p>IntelliLever works with most major property management systems through our open API. It integrates directly with platforms like Cloudbeds, Mews, and other popular PMS systems. For specialized integrations, our technical team can provide guidance on API usage or suggest middleware solutions where necessary.</p>"

                        "question": "Can I use IntelliLever for exterior doors?",
                        "answer": "<p>While IntelliLever carries an IP55 rating and has been salt-spray tested for 200 hours, we generally recommend our IntelliMortise for primary exterior entrances that require higher security. IntelliLever can be used on protected exterior doors (under covered areas) in moderate climates, but may not be suitable for harsh weather conditions or high-security access points.</p>"
