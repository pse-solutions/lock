### The Post Pandemic Workplace

The lines between work and leisure are blurring more than ever before, thanks in part to the rise of remote work and the increasing popularity of bleisure (business leisure) travel. This trend of combining business trips with personal vacations is becoming increasingly common, as travelers seek to maximize their time and create a more balanced lifestyle.

According to a 2023 study by Expedia Group, 42% of business travelers have extended their trips for leisure, with an average of 2.6 additional days added on. This trend is driven by several factors, including:

- The rise of remote work, allows travelers to work from anywhere in the world.

- The increasing flexibility of work schedules makes it easier for travelers to take time off for personal travel.

- The growing popularity of short-term rentals and vacation rentals offers travelers more flexibility and affordability than traditional hotels.

- The desire for travelers to experience more authentic and immersive travel experiences.


### How Smart Locks Cater to Bleisure Travelers

Bleisure travelers have unique needs and expectations. They are looking for hotel experiences that are convenient, flexible, and secure. This is where smart locks come in.

Smart locks offer several benefits for bleisure travelers, including:

1. 24/7 Check-in and Check-out: Bleisure travelers often have flexible schedules and may arrive or depart outside of traditional check-in and check-out times. Smart locks allow them to access their rooms 24/7, eliminating the need to wait at the front desk or coordinate with hotel staff.

2. Remote Access and Control: Bleisure travelers may need to access their rooms to work or store luggage during the day. Smart locks allow them to unlock their doors remotely using their smartphones, even if they are not physically present.

3. Enhanced Security and Peace of Mind: Bleisure travelers often carry valuable equipment and belongings with them. Smart locks offer enhanced security features, such as encryption and keyless entry, along with an audit log, which can help to deter theft and give travelers peace of mind.

4. Personalized Guest Experiences: Smart locks can be integrated with other guest experience software, offering the guests their mobile key or access code, along with local recommendations for them to consider once the business portion of their trip is complete.


Smart locks are an essential part of the modern hotel experience and are becoming increasingly popular among bleisure travelers. By offering convenience, flexibility, security, and personalization, smart locks can help hotels attract and retain bleisure guests.

### Conclusion

Bleisure travel is a growing trend, and hotels need to adapt their offerings to meet the needs of these unique travelers. Smart locks are a valuable tool that can help hotels attract and retain bleisure guests by providing them with a convenient, flexible, and secure experience.
