Hilton recently reported that nearly **50% of its guests** are using digital keys. According to Oracle Hospitality, **26% of guests** said they are more likely to stay at hotels offering contactless options. While boutique and independent hotels have been slower to adopt, the growing demand for a contactless guest experience is driving the shift towards digital credentials.

**Are digital keys becoming the norm for hospitality?**

Digital keys enable a contactless check-in experience. Guests can go straight to their rooms without the need for a physical key exchange, while hotel staff can focus on more valuable tasks. It’s a **win-win**.

But what happens if a phone dies and the guest is locked out? Without a backup solution, the system falls short. Offering an alternative means of access, like a **PIN code** that doesn’t rely on physical devices or mediums, is a smart and reliable addition. PIN codes are also an easy-to-use option for less tech-savvy travellers.

Digital keys are often discussed in terms of **guest experience**, but what about staff? For housekeepers and maintenance, using a phone to unlock doors isn’t always practical—especially with carts full of supplies. Studies show that an overwhelming majority of  staff actually prefer the convenience of **RFID credentials**, like wristbands or fobs, over digital keys for everyday tasks.

**So, what’s our take?**

The trend toward digital key adoption in hospitality will continue, especially as technology advances. However, other key types won’t disappear. Instead, we predict increased **flexibility**, with a mix of key options rather than an industry-wide shift to fully digital credentials.
