## Choosing the Right Access Control Automation Partner

In the world of property management, access control automation is no longer just a convenience—it's a necessity. Whether you're managing vacation rentals, hotels, or multifamily units, the ability to automate and control access remotely can save you time, enhance security, and improve the guest / resident experience. But with so many options on the market, how do you choose the right partner for your business? In this post, we'll explore three leading access control automation providers—Operto, RemoteLock, and Seam—and discuss what to consider when making your choice.

**Understanding Your Needs**

Before diving into the specifics of each provider, it's important to clarify your needs. Ask yourself the following questions:

- **What type of property are you managing?** Different access control systems are designed for different types of properties. A system that works well for a hotel might not be ideal for a multifamily residential building.

- **What level of integration do you need?** Consider how the access control system will integrate with your existing property management software, operations management systems, and with other IoT devices.

- **What is your budget?** Access control systems vary widely in cost, depending on the features and level of service offered.


### **Operto: Hospitality-Focused Automation**

[**Operto**](https://operto.com/) is a leader in access control automation specifically tailored for the hospitality industry. If you manage short-term rentals, hotels, or vacation properties, Operto might be your ideal partner. Here’s why:

- **Seamless Integrations:** Operto integrates with popular property management systems (PMS) like Guesty, Mews, Hostaway, and Cloudbeds, making it easy to automate check-ins and check-outs without manual intervention.

**Consider Operto if:** You're in the hospitality industry and looking for a comprehensive, guest-focused solution that goes beyond basic access control.

### **RemoteLock: Multifamily-Focused Automation**

### **Seam: Developer-Friendly Automation**

[**Seam**](https://www.seam.co/) offers a unique, developer-friendly approach to access control automation. If you’re looking for a highly customizable solution, Seam could be the partner you need.

- **API-First Approach:** Seam is designed with developers in mind, offering a powerful API that allows you to build custom integrations and workflows. This makes it an ideal choice for tech-savvy property managers or businesses with in-house development teams.

**Consider Seam if:** You have specific, complex needs that require a high level of customization, and you have the technical resources to leverage an API-first platform.

### **Key Considerations When Choosing a Partner**

When selecting an access control automation partner, keep these key considerations in mind:

- **Integration:** Ensure that the system integrates seamlessly with your existing technology stack.

- **Scalability:** Choose a platform that can grow with your business, whether you're managing a handful of units or thousands.

- **Support and Reliability:** Look for a partner that offers robust customer support and a reliable platform. Downtime or technical issues can lead to significant disruptions in your operations.

- **Cost:** Balance the features and capabilities of the system against your budget. Remember that the cheapest option isn't always the best—investing in the right technology can save you money in the long run.
