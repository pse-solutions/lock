In hospitality, where time and resources are precious, efficiency and cost management can determine a property’s success. Hotels and motels are seeking innovative solutions to streamline operations, enhance guest satisfaction, and reduce expenses.

Labor shortages remain a challenge across the hospitality industry. In January 2024, over **67.6%** of hoteliers reported staffing shortages, and **72%**were unable to fill open positions, [according to an AHLA survey](https://www.ahla.com/sites/default/files/SOTI.2024.Final_.Draft_.v3.pdf). At the same time, hotel employee wages hit a national average of **$23.91** per hour, the highest ever recorded by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CEU7072100003?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true). These factors further highlight the need for cost-effective, time-saving solutions to help optimize resources and alleviate staffing pressures.

One of the most effective ways to achieve these goals is by [implementing smart access control systems](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/how-to-get-started-with-33-lock). These modern solutions simplify access management and deliver measurable savings in time and money.

In this article, we’ll explore how access control systems can elevate your property’s operations, and deliver new levels of efficiency and profitability.

## 1\. Eliminate the Cost and Hassle of Keys and Keycards

Traditional keys are expensive to replace and pose significant security risks when lost. Misplaced keys can lead to lock replacements, increasing material and labor costs, while lost or damaged keycards lead to ongoing replacement expenses.

Modern access control systems can eliminate the need for physical keys by enabling operators to issue and manage digital credentials like [PIN codes](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/unlocking-flexibility-three-innovative-ways-to-set-a-pin-code) or mobile keys. These credentials can customized as time-sensitive (activating at check-in and expiring at check-out for guests), or set as permanent for staff. This eliminates unauthorized access and reduces administrative labor.

**Savings**:

- Eliminates recurring expenses for producing and replacing lost or damaged keys.

- Minimizes labor costs and operational downtime caused by lock replacements or rekeying.


## 2\. Streamline Check-In and Check-Out

Manually managing guest access is labor-intensive and often requires staffing the front desk 24/7. Front desk bottlenecks during peak check-in and check-out times can frustrate guests and overwork staff.

Smart locks drastically reduce front desk workload by enabling self-check-in and check-out, eliminating the need for staff to issue or reprogram keys, manage inventory, and respond to lockouts. Instead, guests receive [digital keys](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/are-digital-keys-the-future-of-hospitality) via their smartphones or unique PIN codes before arrival. Automation reduces the need for front desk staff, minimizes wait times, and improves guest satisfaction. It also frees staff to focus on other priorities, like providing personalized guest services or handling complex inquiries.

**Savings**:

- Lower staffing requirements with reduced reliance on front desk staff for manual tasks like programming and distributing keycards.

- Improved guest experiences lead to better reviews and repeat bookings, reducing acquisition costs for new guests.

## 3\. Lower Maintenance and Replacement Costs

Traditional locks wear out over time, especially in high-traffic environments, and hardware maintenance and replacements can be expensive. Rekeying locks regularly can be an additional cost, especially in properties with seasonal staff or contractors.

Smart locks, [like those from 33 Lock](https://www.33lock.com/collection), are designed with advanced materials and mechanisms for durability and require minimal upkeep. Wireless firmware updates ensure the locks maintain the latest technology without requiring physical changes to the locks themselves. This reduces the need for on-site maintenance, extends the lifespan of locks, and minimizes guest issues.

**Savings**:

- Reduced maintenance and repair expenses.

- Extended lifespan of access control systems.


## 4\. Reduce On-Site Staffing Requirements

Managing and maintaining on-site staff to handle tasks like guest check-ins and check-outs, key distribution, and coordinating access for maintenance teams or contractors can be resource-intensive and inefficient. These repetitive, transactional duties often overburden front desk teams, leaving little time for personalized guest service.

Smart access control systems allow operators to [reimagine the traditional front desk model](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/hotel-check-in-smart-technology). With features like digital check-in and remote access management, properties can adopt a fully front-deskless approach or a hybrid model with minimal staff. Automated access management allows staff to focus on enhancing the guest experience instead of managing transactional tasks.

**Savings:**

- Low labor costs due to reduced staffing needs.

- Increased productivity by allowing staff to focus on higher-value tasks.

- Lower staff turnover rates by reducing repetitive, manual tasks that often lead to burnout.

## 5\. Improve Security and Reduce Liability

Security breaches can be costly—not just in terms of lost revenue but also in damage to your property’s reputation. Traditional lock systems are vulnerable to key theft, duplication, and unauthorized entry, creating security risks for properties.

Smart locks address these vulnerabilities with advanced access control features. Systems like 33 Lock provide detailed logs and real-time tracking, so you always know who accessed specific rooms, and when. This data enhances accountability and gives operators recorded data, which can be invaluable for resolving disputes or addressing potential liabilities. Lost or stolen keycards are no longer a risk, as permissions can be instantly revoked or modified.

**Savings:**

- Instantly deactivate access credentials instead of replacing locks and keys.

- Lower liability risks with enhanced security and tracking.

- Simplify incident resolution with real-time access logs.


## 6\. Integrate Seamlessly with Existing Systems

Smart locks create opportunities to [further automate property operations.](https://www.33lock.com/partners) Integrating with energy management systems, guest experience apps, and upsell platforms can reduce expenses and effortlessly increase revenue streams.

Energy management tools sync with smart locks to adjust lighting and HVAC settings based on occupancy to cut utility bills. Guest apps streamline check-in, communication, and service requests, reducing labor costs. Upsell features enable properties to offer early check-ins, late check-outs, room upgrades, and add-on services, increasing revenue and guest satisfaction.

**Savings:**

- Automatically adjust lighting, heating, and cooling systems to lower energy costs.

- Easily drive additional revenue through automated upsells and add-ons.

- Save time with streamlined guest communication.


## The Key to Efficiency and Savings

Smart locks empower hospitality operators to provide exceptional service while keeping costs under control. They replace outdated processes with streamlined, tech-driven solutions that cut unnecessary expenses, optimize staff resources, and enhance the guest experience. The result is happier guests, lower overhead, a stronger bottom line, and a future-ready business model.
