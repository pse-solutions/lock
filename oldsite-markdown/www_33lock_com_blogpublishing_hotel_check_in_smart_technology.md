Forget the long queues and laminated smiles. The [hospitality landscape is changing](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/are-digital-keys-the-future-of-hospitality), and the traditional front desk is taking a backseat to innovative, technology-driven models. Enter front-deskless hotels, where convenience and automation reign supreme.

But what exactly does "front-deskless" entail, and how does it work? In this article, we’ll explore the models that are making this shift possible, examine the benefits, and weigh the considerations operators need to take into account when moving to a front-deskless model.

## Model 1: The Conventional Front Desk

This is the model most guests are familiar with. Regardless of their arrival time, they head straight to the front desk when arriving at the property. This is where they are helped by front desk staff who verify their ID, swipe a credit card, and cut a keycard for a room. While this process is familiar and straightforward, it has its drawbacks. Long lines, delayed check-ins, and the hassle of waiting for assistance can frustrate guests, especially after a long journey.

With [advancements in technology,](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/2024-look-ahead) this traditional model is being challenged by more efficient, automated alternatives that can streamline the check-in process and enhance guest satisfaction.

## Model 2: The Kiosk

This model replaces the human touch with sleek kiosks that handle everything from check-in and issuing keys to payment processing and even local recommendations. Think of it as a self-service check-in station, similar to airport check-in kiosks but with enhanced features. These kiosks allow guests to check in independently, verify their identity, process payment, and receive their room key — all without the need for human interaction.

Kiosks are equipped with intuitive interfaces, multilingual support, and the ability to process various forms of payment. They can be appealing to tech-savvy travelers who prefer independence and efficiency.

While kiosks are an excellent solution for some properties, they may still require support staff to assist with issues that arise. Additionally, depending on the number of kiosks available and the volume of guests checking in, kiosks may not eliminate check-in queues.

## Model 3: Digital Check-in Applications

In this model, a guest’s smartphone becomes their ultimate tool for a seamless stay. Guests can check in and access their rooms without needing to visit a front desk or touch a physical key. Everything is handled digitally before the guest arrives at the property, including ID verification, adding a credit card on file, agreeing to property rules, receiving room access credentials, and learning about amenities and local recommendations. This is usually done by sending guests the information they need ahead of arrival via email, text, smartphone browser, or app.

Smart locks, [like those offered by 33 Lock](https://www.33lock.com/collection), are integral to this model, allowing guests to access their rooms with a [PIN code](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/unlocking-flexibility-three-innovative-ways-to-set-a-pin-code) or digital key.

The convenience of having a virtual concierge in their pocket is a powerful draw for guests, especially those who value autonomy and convenience.

## Model 3: The Hybrid Hero

While completely front-deskless hotels offer a sleek, efficient experience, not all properties are ready to go fully digital. This model marries the best of both worlds, balancing automation with the personal touch of human interaction. A streamlined check-in process and keyless access are combined with a pared-down front desk with minimal staff available for more complex tasks, such as troubleshooting or offering local recommendations.

By reducing the manual tasks that front desk staff generally manage, this hybrid model frees up staff to handle more personalized, valuable interactions. The focus is on streamlined processes, and efficient interactions with a human touch to ensure guests feel welcome and supported, making it an appealing option for hotels that aren’t ready to completely eliminate their front desk.

## 4 Signs It's Time to Improve Your Hotel Check-In Process

If any of these challenges sound familiar, [it could be time to update your hotel’s check-in process](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/6-reasons-to-upgrade-hotel-locks).

1. **Long wait times at the front desk**

Guests don’t want to spend time waiting, especially after traveling long distances or arriving late at night. If your lobby is consistently filled with people waiting to check in, it’s a sign to rethink your check-in approach.

2. **Guest complaints**

Review guest feedback for any recurring issues related to check-in. Complaints about long lines, slow service at the front desk, or a cumbersome arrival process highlight areas for improvement in your operations.

3. **High employee turnover**

The hospitality industry often sees high turnover, with an [average rate of 74%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t04.htm) annually. However, if employee departures are increasing, it may indicate that the current check-in process is creating stress and contributing to burnout among staff.

4. **Negative staff feedback**

Even if your front desk staff aren’t leaving, their feedback can still signal problems. If employees are expressing dissatisfaction with their workload, check-in procedures, or general productivity, it’s a sign that changes are needed.


## The Role of Smart Locks in Front-Deskless Hotels

At the heart of the front-deskless hotel model are smart locks, which provide a seamless and efficient guest experience that aligns with the growing demand for automation in the hospitality industry. These locks use advanced technology to grant guests access to their rooms using a PIN code or digital key, which can be sent via email, SMS, or mobile app.

This solution offers convenience for guests, who can bypass long lines at the front desk. For hotels, it improves operational efficiency by reducing staff workload and eliminating the risk of lost or demagnetized keycards.

Smart locks can also be managed remotely, offering real-time monitoring and access control. This improves security, provides greater flexibility for guests and delivers cost savings for hotel operators.

## The Benefits of a Front-Deskless Model

Implementing check-in automation at your property results in a range of benefits. Here’s how it can help your hotel:

- With fewer staff members required at the front desk and fewer manual tasks, employees can focus on meaningful guest interactions and providing great guest experiences. It may also improve staff retention rates by reducing the stress and burnout associated with front–desk responsibilities.

- Less staff equals lower overhead, saving admin time and costs.

- It saves money on traditional keys and keycards. No need to replace lost, stolen, or demagnetized keycards, saving money, time, and plastic.

- It improves the guest experience. Guests can arrive anytime after check-in without having to wait at a front desk and can head straight to their room to begin their travel plans.

- An improved guest experience can lead to better reviews, ultimately increasing occupancy and average daily rates (ADR), and driving more return bookings.

- Offering pre-stay online check-in allows guests to start interacting with your brand well before their stay, and can boost revenue. Utilizing a guest app alongside digital check-in provides guests with a tool to browse hotel services and amenities, and book experiences before they arrive.

- It’s safer and more secure. Smart locks can be remotely monitored in real-time, allowing operators to quickly respond to any security concerns. Lost or stolen keycards are no longer a risk, as digital access credentials can be instantly revoked or modified. These systems can also track entry times and provide detailed logs, further enhancing security and offering peace of mind for guests and hotel staff.


## Key Considerations When Transitioning to a Front-Deskless Model

While the front-deskless model offers many advantages and exciting possibilities, there are some important considerations to keep in mind before making the switch.

1. **Upfront costs and integration**

Implementing kiosks, smart locks, and digital check-in software requires an upfront investment. [Hotel operators must assess these costs](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/installing-hotel-smart-locks-cost), evaluate the return on investment, and ensure the adopted technology is user-friendly, reliable, and secure.

2. **Staff training**

Whether operating a fully front-deskless or hybrid model, staff still play a role in providing customer service. Ensuring staff are well-trained in troubleshooting and offering personalized assistance when needed — even if remotely — helps bridge the gap and ensure guests feel valued.

3. **Guest education and support**

Despite the rapid evolution in self-service technologies across industries, not everyone is comfortable relying solely on technology. Clear communication is essential to avoid confusion. Ensure guests know exactly how to check in and access their rooms before arrival, providing instructions via email or within your guest app, if using one. Offer support options like phone lines, chat, or readily available staff members, for those who need them.


## The Future of Hospitality

Front-deskless models are not here to replace traditional hospitality, but to enhance it through the smart, thoughtful integration of technology. Embracing automation and self-check-in solutions allows hotels to provide guests with the autonomy and convenience they desire while reducing operational costs and alleviating staff workload.

[With smart lock solutions](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/ttlock-unlocking-convenience-and-simplified-access-control-management) like those provided by 33 Lock, hotels can offer secure, digital access and streamline check-ins. Implementing a front-deskless model with the right tools empowers hotels to meet modern expectations and deliver exceptional service while streamlining operations.

The future of hospitality is about finding the perfect blend of human touch, technological innovation, and unwavering commitment to guest safety and well-being. As the industry continues to innovate, front-deskless models are poised to offer a more flexible, efficient, and accessible experience for guests and operators.
