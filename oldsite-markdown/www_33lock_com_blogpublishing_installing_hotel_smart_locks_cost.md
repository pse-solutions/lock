The adoption of smart locks is [transforming the hospitality industry](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/are-digital-keys-the-future-of-hospitality), allowing hotels to reduce staff workload while offering guests a more independent and flexible experience. Although the initial cost of upgrading to smart locks can be a consideration, the good news is that advances in technology have made these systems accessible to properties of all sizes and budgets.

This article breaks down the costs associated with installing hotel smart locks and explores the benefits and return on investment (ROI) these systems deliver.

## What are Hotel Smart Locks?

Hotel smart locks use technologies like PIN codes, mobile keys, RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and even biometrics to control room access. Unlike traditional locks that rely on physical keys, smart locks allow for centralized remote management, real-time monitoring, and enhanced operational efficiency. They are designed to simplify access control and improve the guest experience.

## Costs to Consider When Installing Hotel Smart Locks

The initial cost of installing smart locks depends on several factors, including the type of system you choose, the size of your property, and whether you need integrations with other systems, such as additional automation solutions. While smart locks generally come with a higher upfront cost than traditional locks, this upfront cost should be viewed through the lens of long-term value.

Compared to the ongoing costs of maintaining traditional locks, smart locks are often a more cost-effective solution. Traditional key systems require regular key replacements and extensive manual management, which can add up over time. With smart locks, these costs are greatly reduced. For example, there’s no need to worry about lost or demagnetized keycards, and remote access management eliminates the need for on-site staff to deal with key distribution.

Here are some of the primary costs to consider:

1. **Hardware Costs**

Smart locks are generally more expensive upfront than traditional locks due to the technology they incorporate. The cost per door varies based on the system’s features, the lock's durability, and the brand. Although some systems may charge a premium for advanced features like mobile app integration or cloud-based management, others offer more affordable options.

2. **Installation and Setup**

Installing smart locks is simpler than many people expect. While there may be some initial setup required, such as integrating the system with your building infrastructure and other software, the process is generally straightforward. Properties with the necessary team and resources can opt to handle installation themselves, which can help reduce costs. For those who prefer professional assistance, 33 Lock can provide references to trusted installation partners. Factoring in whether to handle the installation internally or hire external professionals will help you better estimate the total installation costs and plan accordingly.

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**

One of the key benefits of smart locks is their low maintenance requirements. Unlike traditional key systems, which can require frequent maintenance and replacement, smart locks are designed to be durable and reliable. Many cloud-based smart lock systems can be updated wirelessly with firmware improvements, ensuring the locks maintain the latest technology without requiring physical changes to the lock itself.


## The Benefits and ROI of Hotel Smart Locks

Implementing smart door locks for hotels can lead to substantial operational savings such as:

1. **Labor and Administrative Savings**

Hotel smart lock systems offer significant reductions in labor and administrative costs. Traditional locks require manual management, such as issuing physical keys, handling lost or demagnetized cards, and maintaining inventories. These tasks can be time-consuming, especially during peak times.



Smart locks streamline these processes by allowing guests to access rooms with [PIN codes](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/unlocking-flexibility-three-innovative-ways-to-set-a-pin-code) or digital keys. This eliminates the need for physical keycards, leading to further cost savings. The system also allows for easy generation of temporary access credentials for staff or contractors, further reducing the burden on front desk staff and freeing up time for other priorities.

2. **Increased Guest Satisfaction**

Guests increasingly expect seamless, tech-forward experiences during their stays. The ability to bypass traditional key check-in processes and access their rooms using a PIN code or mobile key is becoming more popular. Many guests appreciate the convenience of smart locks which allow for more personalized experiences and quicker check-ins.



Providing a convenient, modern experience can improve guest reviews, attract more bookings, and support higher room rates, all of which contribute to the property’s bottom line.

3. **Opening Opportunities for Further Automation**

In addition to the direct operational benefits of smart locks, these systems open up exciting opportunities to automate other aspects of your property’s management. With smart locks from 33 Lock, for instance, you can integrate your locks with other systems on your property, from guest experience apps to housekeeping management and energy control.
