## Optimizing Smart Lock Management

Determining the optimal method for managing locks, whether online or offline, depends on the unique requirements of your property. To guide your decision-making process, here are some key factors to consider when determining which system is best for you:

### **Application:** hospitality vs. multifamily smart locks

- Online provides a significant advantage for properties that operate as, or function like a hotel.

- Offline is a great alternative for most multifamily residential applications.


### **Length of stay**: long-term vs. short-term stays

- Online is best suited for properties that have a high occupancy turnover rate, including nightly or weekly stays.

- Offline is great for properties with less frequent occupant turnover, typically on a month-to-month or annual contract.


### **Ownership model**: individually owned vs. corporately owned

- Online \- is preferable if access to suites is managed by a central authority, such as a property management company.

- Offline \- A viable choice for condo buildings, or similar property types, where each suite is independently owned and managed.


### **Budget**: adaptable vs. cost-conscious

- Online generally entails higher costs due to the additional infrastructure needed for lock-to-cloud connectivity.

- Offline represents a more economical choice as it doesn't necessitate supplementary infrastructure to uphold the system.


### **Number of users**: limited users vs. many users

- Online is advantageous when managing many different users and user types, such as properties where cleaners or maintenance people frequently require access to suites.

- Offline is sufficient when a smaller number of users require suite access, such as those that are self cleaned and managed.


### **Onsite staff**: onsite staff vs. no staff at the property

- Online is ideal for properties that wish to reduce the number of onsite staff, or operate with no onsite staff at all.

- Offline works for properties where there are onsite staff available to update credentials, such as those that operate a front-desk or concierge service.


### **Network infrastructure**: solid foundation vs. unstable foundation

- Online solutions integrate best with properties that have a solid network foundation, more typically found in newer buildings and urban areas.

- Offline may provide a better option for older buildings or those with limited internet access in rural or remote areas.


### **Construction phase**: retrofit vs. new build

- Online is easier for new buildings where there is the ability to plan ahead for cable runs and wifi access points

- Offline lends well to retrofitting an existing property with little to no renovation work required.


### **Ease and convenience**: active involvement vs. hands-off

- Online is best for those that wish to move toward a near, or fully automated access control system, that easily integrates with their other systems.

- Offline is best for properties that are okay with a slightly less streamlined approach to managing access.


### **Access to common spaces:** abundant amenities vs. few amenities

- Online is the seemingly perfect choice for properties that offer open or bookable spaces for residents or guests.

- Offline works well for properties with fewer amenities such as gyms, pools, studios, meeting rooms, etc.


## Smart Lock Considerations

Determining the ideal solution is not straightforward, as it hinges on the specific needs of your property.

As a guiding principle, **Hospitality** applications often experience substantial advantages by transitioning to an online system, where increased automation can notably reduce overhead costs and increase operational efficiency.

Conversely, for many **Multifamily** applications such as condos or apartment complexes characterized by lower turnover rates and fewer individuals requiring suite access, an offline solution may suffice entirely.

The advantage of choosing 33 Lock, is that our locks feature both online and offline capabilities, allowing you to effortlessly transition them between modes as needed in the future.
