Renovating your hotel is an opportunity to redefine your brand, optimize operations, and deliver a guest experience that leaves a lasting impression. Modern travelers expect more than just a comfortable bed — they’re seeking convenience, innovation, and personalized experiences.

[Incorporating technology](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/introducing-new-tech-at-your-property) into your renovation plans can help your property stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly competitive market and deliver on changing guest expectations.

Whether you’re planning a major overhaul or making incremental improvements, the right upgrades can elevate your property’s appeal, create new efficiencies and revenue streams, and meet the expectations of today’s tech-savvy travelers.

Here are some innovative ideas to consider:

## 1\. Implement Smart Locks and Digital Check-In

One of the most impactful upgrades you can make during a renovation is adopting keyless entry systems and [digital check-in](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/hotel-check-in-smart-technology). Replacing traditional locks with smart locks offers convenience, enhanced security, and reduced operational costs.

With affordable and flexible smart lock solutions like [those from 33 Lock](https://www.33lock.com/collection), guests can bypass long check-in lines and access their rooms using unique PIN codes or digital keys on their smartphones. Features like real-time monitoring allow staff to confirm when guests have checked in. Transactional tasks like distributing key cards are no longer necessary, meaning staff can focus on creating more memorable guest experiences.

## 2\. Reimagine the Front Desk and Lobby

The lobby is often a guest’s first impression of your hotel, making it a powerful opportunity to set the tone for their stay and create additional revenue streams. Traditionally, the front desk occupies prime real estate in this space, but with the [adoption of digital check-ins and contactless solutions](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/installing-hotel-smart-locks-cost) like smart locks, the need for a large front desk is diminishing. This opens up valuable square footage to reimagine your lobby as a vibrant, multifunctional hub.

Post-pandemic travel trends highlight the importance of multifunctional spaces. Travelers now seek areas that blend work, leisure, and social interaction. Your lobby can be redesigned to accommodate these changing needs. Thanks to digital check-in, staff can be freed up from behind the front desk and redirect their focus to delivering personalized services and creating memorable experiences for guests.

Some ways to repurpose and maximize this area include:

- A coffee or tea shop offering local blends to give guests a taste of your destination’s unique flavors.

- A contemporary bar area with comfortable seating and personalized drink recommendations to create a chic social hotspot for guests.

- A boutique retail space, stocking essential items alongside locally crafted specialty goods.

- A bookstore or gallery that showcases works by local authors and artists, giving guests a cultural connection to the area while supporting local talent.

- A co-working space with ample outlets, high-speed internet, and comfortable seating to cater to business or [bleisure travelers](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/the-rise-of-bleisure-travel-how-smart-locks-cater-to-todays-modern-traveler) and digital nomads.

- A comfortable lounge area for guests to read or unwind.

- A smaller, flexible service area where a staff member can provide personalized recommendations and attention as needed.


If fully removing the front desk feels like a big step, a hybrid model could be the solution: a smaller, flexible service area where a staff member can provide personalized recommendations or answer any questions as needed, complemented by streamlined digital check-in.

## 3\. Enhance In-Room Technology

Travelers are accustomed to enjoying technological conveniences in their homes and increasingly expect accommodations to be equipped with these modern amenities. Incorporating smart technology can provide a luxury experience with added convenience.

Consider the following upgrades:

- Provide access to popular streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu on in-room TVs, allowing guests to stream their favorite shows and movies.

- Incorporate voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant into guest rooms to control lights, adjust temperatures, control entertainment systems, and provide information and local recommendations with simple voice commands.

- In addition to ample outlets throughout the room, install charging stations with USB ports or wireless charging capabilities for added convenience.

- Realiable internet is essential for business and leisure travelers and is viewed as a non-negotiable amenity by many guests. Ensure your hotel offers high-speed internet throughout the property.


## 4\. Upgrade to Energy-Efficient Solutions

Incorporating energy-efficient and environmentally friendly upgrades into your renovations appeals to eco-conscious guests and reduces operational costs, making your property a smarter, greener, and more desirable destination. Pairing these solutions with automation technology further enhances savings and efficiency.

- Replace traditional lights with energy-efficient LED bulbs, which consume up to 75% less energy and last 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs. This saves on energy bills and reduces maintenance costs over time. Motion-activated sensors and smart scheduling further reduce energy consumption by ensuring lights are only used when needed.


- Install smart thermostats and upgrade outdated HVAC systems with energy-efficient models that integrate with centralized platforms to offer personalized climate control while optimizing energy use.

- Enable guests to control room temperatures through mobile capabilities or voice assistance, adding convenience to their stay. Automation software can manage heating and cooling based on check-ins and occupancy, and adjust heating and cooling based on check-ins, ensuring comfort and minimizing energy waste.

## 5\. Incorporate Green Spaces

Adding green spaces to your property enhances its aesthetic appeal, improves air quality, promotes relaxation and shows a commitment to sustainability.

Some ways to incorporate green spaces into your hotel include:

- Installing living walls in common areas like lobbies or lounges for a striking visual statement that helps improve air quality.

- Transforming unused rooftop areas into vibrant gardens or terraces. These spaces can double as outdoor dining areas, event venues, or quiet retreats for guests. Utilizing the space to grow herbs and produce can supply fresh ingredients for the hotel’s restaurant or bar.

- Incorporating green spaces into wellness areas such as outdoor yoga decks, meditation zones, or nature-inspired spa facilities to cater to guests seeking relaxation and rejuvenation.


## 6\. Add Local and Cultural Touches

Renovating your hotel provides a chance to celebrate the local culture an environment, offering guests a unique sense of place. Here are ways to incorporate local andn cultural elements into your property:

- Feature local art and decor. Showcase custom murals, sculptures, or artisan-crafted pieces to reflect the region’s culture and uniqueness.

- Source fresh, local ingredients for your dining options to support the local economy and offer guests a true taste of the area.

- Offer local tours and excursions to create a deeper connection to the destination.
