[**Sosuite**](https://staysosuite.com/), a tech-forward accommodation operator based in Philadelphia, manages hundreds of thoughtfully designed apartments across the city. Blending the best of hotels with the comforts of home, their focus on frictionless technology and delivering exceptional guest experiences has set them apart in a competitive market.

Sosuite’s early adoption of contactless check-in practices allowed the company to scale quickly without relying on front desk staff. As their technology stack grew, incorporating locks, thermostats, guest verification, task automation, and more, Sosuite needed a centralized system to manage it at scale. To meet this need, they developed [**SuiteOp**](https://suiteop.com/), a property operations platform that connects IoT (internet of things) devices, guest-facing portals, and backend operations into a single centralized system.

Today, SuiteOp powers Sosuite’s internal operations and supports thousands of other accommodation providers — from small boutiques to large-scale hospitality groups — seeking a scalable and modern property technology solution.

## The Challenge

As Sosuite expanded and acquired properties with existing access control systems, it became clear that legacy locks were creating more problems than they solved, particularly for a model built around seamless, contactless check-in. These systems were expensive to purchase and maintain, prone to connectivity issues, and overly complex to manage. In addition to high upfront costs for hardware, they required recurring subscription fees and specialized support from third-party vendors.

Frequent lock failures demanded hours of internal troubleshooting and often led to delays while waiting on costly third-party support. This pulled valuable time and resources away from core operations and led to a poor guest experience.

Every lockout had a cost: emergency support fees, staff time, negative guest reviews, and lost bookings. With guest satisfaction and operational efficiency suffering, Sosuite needed a more reliable and cost-effective access solution.

## The Solution

33 Lock checked all the boxes for Sosuite. [The locks](https://www.33lock.com/collection) offered deep functionality at an affordable cost, combining user-friendly operation with dependable performance to enable independent guest entry. They also provided multiple entry methods to support a wide range of access needs.

**Why Sosuite chose 33 Lock:**

1. **Cost-effective:** Affordable hardware with no ongoing vendor support fees significantly reduced operational expenses and delivered fast ROI.

2. **Clear, transparent product offering:** Sosuite valued the simplicity of the 33 Lock system, which provided deep functionality through an easy-to-manage solution.

3. **Compatibility without complexity**: After struggling with overly complex and expensive lock systems, 33 Lock provided a high-quality, easy-to-install solution that worked right out of the box at a fraction of the cost.

4. **Built-in redundancy**: The locks provided multiple entry methods, including PIN, RFID, mobile access, and backup methods, reducing the risk of lockouts.

5. **Modern, user-friendly aesthetic:** The sleek and modern design of 33 Locks aligned with Sosuite’s brand and simplified the guest experience.

6. **SuiteOp integration:** 33 Lock’s deep integration with SuiteOp eliminated the need for third-party platforms, saving Sosuite money on service fees and giving the team complete visibility and control over property management.


Installation was quick and seamless, with 33 Lock’s expert support ensuring a smooth rollout. **“ _I’ve been in the industry for years and worked with the major brands, but never experienced this level of support. Getting fast, informed answers from someone who truly knows the product was a game changer_,”** shared Christy Fitzpatrick, CEO of Sosuite.

> “33 Lock was a no-brainer. One factor was related to cost — the ROI was obvious. The second factor was the type of locks. 33 Lock is easy to navigate; it’s clear what the product is, what the functionalities are, and you aren’t making any tradeoffs. The locks have multiple ways of entry available through all their products. They’re aesthetically pleasing, form-focused, and simple to operate. It came down to the combination of reliability, cost, and flexibility.”

— Simon Seroussi, co-founder and COO of SuiteOp

## The Results

Avoiding expensive hardware and eliminating costly annual maintenance fees saved Sosuite **58%** on access control in the first year alone. Eliminating recurring lock failures gave the team a full working day back each month, time that was previously lost to troubleshooting guest access issues during peak periods. With smoother check-ins and fully reliable access, guest satisfaction noticeably improved.

Staff could easily track entry history, monitor battery levels, and trigger automated tasks, such as lock maintenance, from a centralized dashboard. Guests, once verified, could manage access directly through SuiteOp’s branded portal using features like swipe-to-unlock.
