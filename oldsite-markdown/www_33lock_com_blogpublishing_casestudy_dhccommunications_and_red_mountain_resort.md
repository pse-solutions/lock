[**DHC Communications Inc.**](https://dhc.bc.ca/), based in British Columbia’s Kootenay region, is a leading provider of technology infrastructure solutions. They specialize in designing, installing and programming security, networking, and management systems for various accommodation providers. When RED Mountain Resort, one of North America’s largest ski destinations, needed a modern, reliable access control system to support its expanding lodging operations, DHC Communications Inc. was brought in to find the right solution.

## The Challenge

RED Mountain Resort, located in the heart of the Monashee Mountain range in British Columbia, is a premier ski destination known for its deep powder, vast terrain, and authentic mountain-town charm. Spanning 4,200 acres, the resort attracts skiers and adventurers worldwide.

As the resort expanded and developed its lodging options to accommodate growing visitor demand, its aging electronic locks became a growing challenge. Frequent failures required increasing troubleshooting, adding administrative strain and causing frustration.

The resort’s properties included individually owned condos with two distinct management structures: some owners self-managed their condos, while others participated in a rental pool.  RED Mountain Resort Lodging was responsible for issuing keycards to all guests, including those staying in non-rental pool units. To grant their guests access, individual owners had to notify the resort in advance of arrival, adding administrative steps and inefficiencies. Any new access control solution had to support both models — giving the property manager centralized oversight of rental pool units while allowing independent owners to retain full control over their locks and access settings.

RED Mountain needed a modern solution that would deliver:

1. **Reliability and consistency:** The system needed to eliminate lock failures and function seamlessly in a high-traffic environment.

2. **Efficient distribution of access credentials:** Eliminating the need for lodging staff to manually coordinate and issue keycards for guests of non-rental pool properties was essential for streamlining operations.

3. **Ease of management:** A simple, automated platform was necessary to reduce administrative workload.

4. **Flexible access control:** The solution had to support guest access, staff permissions, and customized permissions for rental pool and independent condo owners.

## The Solution

DHC Communications Inc. thoroughly assessed the resort’s challenges and goals, and evaluated available access solutions before identifying 33 Lock as the ideal provider. [33 Lock’s smart access system](https://www.33lock.com/collection) stood out for its advanced functionality, ease of integration, and affordability, making it the perfect fit for RED Mountain’s needs. The system provided:

1. **Remote management**: Access could be controlled and monitored from anywhere, reducing the need for on-site troubleshooting.

2. **Custom access control:** Unique user permissions could be assigned to guests, owners, staff, and maintenance teams.

3. **Dependable performance:** Lock failures were eliminated, improving reliability and saving time.

4. **Secure and convenient access credentials**: [PIN codes](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/unlocking-flexibility-three-innovative-ways-to-set-a-pin-code) replaced physical key cards to simplify access for guests and reduce security risks.
