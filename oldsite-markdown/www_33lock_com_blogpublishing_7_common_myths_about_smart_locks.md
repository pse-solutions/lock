Smart technology is modernizing the hospitality industry, and smart locks in particular are bringing a new era of streamlined security, operational efficiency, and guest convenience. Yet, despite all the benefits they bring, misconceptions and myths about smart locks still linger that can hold hotels, motels, and resorts back from embracing this innovative technology.

We’ve debunked seven of the most common myths about smart locks, so you can separate fact from fiction and make informed decisions about upgrading your access control.

### Myth \#1: Smart locks are less secure than traditional locks.

**Reality**: Smart locks offer superior security compared to their traditional counterparts. They grant access through secure [PIN codes](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/unlocking-flexibility-three-innovative-ways-to-set-a-pin-code), [digital keys](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/are-digital-keys-the-future-of-hospitality), or key cards, all of which can be granted or revoked instantly. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and eliminates vulnerabilities associated with physical keys, such as theft or duplication. Smart locks also provide real-time access logs, adding a layer of accountability and transparency that traditional locks can’t match.

### Myth \#2: Guests find smart locks too complicated.

**Reality:** Modern smart locks are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Guests can access their rooms with ease, whether by tapping their smartphone or entering a simple, unique PIN code, often eliminating the need for physical keys. 33 Lock offers  “omni-access”, meaning you can grant mobile keys to your more tech-savvy guests while granting key cards to those who prefer something more tangible. It’s about providing individual guests with the lock experience they’re most comfortable with.

### Myth \#3: They're expensive and impractical for smaller properties.

**Reality:** Although smart locks require an initial investment, affordable options like 33 Locks are available — often at half the price of many competitors. Properties can reduce expenses associated with key replacement, inventory management, maintenance, and staff workload by [installing smart locks](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/installing-hotel-smart-locks-cost). The long-term cost savings and operational benefits make them a valuable asset for any property.

### Myth \#4: They lock you into a single provider.

**Reality:** While some manufacturers of smart locks require the use of proprietary software for the duration of a lock’s lifetime, 33 Locks are designed to integrate with a variety of platforms, giving properties the flexibility to choose the solutions that best fit their needs. 33 Lock offers [out-of-the-box access control management software](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/ttlock-unlocking-convenience-and-simplified-access-control-management) for all customers, which is both intuitive and efficient. The software’s flexible design and compatibility make it easy for properties to [connect to APIs](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/direct-api-vs-3rd-party) or use a [third-party integration](https://www.33lock.com/partners). This allows properties to scale their systems as needed, making smart locks adaptable to the operational requirements of today — and into the future — without being tied to one ecosystem.

### Myth \#5: Smart locks are too technical and complicated.

**Reality:** Today’s smart lock systems are designed with user-friendliness in mind, ensuring that anyone, regardless of technical expertise, can easily operate them. Top manufacturers focus on creating straightforward installation processes and intuitive interfaces that simplify usage for both property managers and guests. These locks prioritize functionality without requiring advanced knowledge, making them accessible and convenient for all users.

### Myth \#6: Smart locks don’t work during a power failure.

**Reality:** One of the most persistent misconceptions is that smart locks become non-functional during power failures. Most smart locks operate on battery power, ensuring continued operation during power failures. They often include low-battery alerts to give property managers ample time to replace batteries before issues arise. For added peace of mind, some systems also come with backup power and physical keys. These features ensure reliability in any condition, so your property remains operational and secure.

### Myth \#7: They depersonalize the guest experience.

**Reality:** Far from depersonalizing the guest experience, smart locks enhance it. They enable [quicker check-ins](https://www.33lock.com/blogpublishing/hotel-check-in-smart-technology) and personalized experiences, giving guests a seamless and convenient start to their stay. Integrations with other smart systems can further improve the guest’s experience. Imagine guests enjoying pre-programmed room temperatures, automated light settings, or tailored amenity recommendations. Offering pre-stay online check-in allows guests to start interacting with your brand well before arrival, providing opportunities to present upsells and add-ons like early check-in or amenities. Hospitality is about creating memorable experiences, and smart locks are an innovative tool to achieve this while leading to better reviews and more return guests.
