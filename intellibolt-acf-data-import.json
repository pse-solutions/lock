This is sufficient for most sliding doors, gates, and cabinets. The actual strength depends on proper alignment and full contact between the lock body and strike plate. For high-security applications, we recommend the optional screw mounting in addition to the adhesive.</p>"

To remove, use dental floss or fishing line with a sawing motion behind the mounted unit, then clean any residue with isopropyl alcohol. Some surfaces (particularly painted or veneered) may require touch-up after removal. For historic or delicate surfaces, we recommend testing on an inconspicuous area first.</p>"

This provides additional protection against rain, dust, and temperature extremes. For complete outdoor installations like gate access, consider our purpose-built outdoor model which offers IP66 weather protection without additional accessories.</p>"

This means it integrates with popular property management systems, vacation rental platforms, and smart home ecosystems. Our open API documentation allows custom integration with virtually any third-party system. For specific integration questions, our solutions team can provide detailed guidance.</p>"

During a power outage, the lock continues to function normally, including maintaining scheduled access codes and logging entries. If the batteries are depleted, the included USB-C emergency power port allows you to power the lock with any power bank or phone charger to gain access.</p>"
